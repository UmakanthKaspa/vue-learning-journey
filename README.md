  <summary><strong>Vue CLI Bigger Projects 🚀</strong></summary>

  ## Introduction
  In this section, you'll level up your Vue.js skills by tackling larger projects using Vue CLI. You'll explore setting up substantial projects, working with Vue files and templates, using template refs, creating and managing multiple components, understanding the parent-child component relationship, and building a complex component tree.

## Topics Covered

### Installing Node.js

Before diving into Vue.js projects, it's essential to install Node.js, the runtime environment for JavaScript. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server side and provides essential tools for web development.

### Using Vue CLI

Vue CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies setting up and managing Vue.js projects. It provides a structured project template and a wide range of features, making the development process smoother and more efficient.

### Creating a new project walkthrough

Starting a new Vue.js project with Vue CLI is a breeze. This walkthrough will guide you through creating a new project, ensuring a solid foundation for your development journey.

### Working with Vue files and templates

Vue.js projects are centered around components. Understanding how to work with Vue files and templates is crucial. Explore the structuring of Vue components and the creation of dynamic templates for your applications.

### Template refs

Unlock the power of template refs, a feature that allows you to reference and interact with elements in your Vue templates. Learn how to use template refs to access and manipulate elements within your components.

### Creating and managing multiple components

Large projects often require breaking the user interface into smaller, reusable components. Learn how to create and manage multiple components, enabling a more organized and maintainable codebase.

### Understanding the parent and child component relationship

Vue.js follows a hierarchical component structure, where components can be parent or child components. Understanding how parent and child components interact is essential for building complex user interfaces.

### Building a component tree

In Vue.js, components form a tree-like structure. Learn how to build a component tree by composing components and creating a clear hierarchy for your application.

## Styling and Components

- Apply style to a component, affecting not only the component itself but also other components used within it.
- Use the "scoped" attribute to limit styles to a specific component.
- For global CSS styles, create a `global.css` file in the assets folder and import it in your `main.js` file.

## Working with Props

- Props make components more reusable and dynamic.
- Use data binding (`:`) to pass data types other than strings.

## Emitting Custom Events

- Components can emit custom events, allowing you to listen to those events where the component is used.

## Click Event Modifiers

- Enhance the behavior of click events using modifiers like `@click`, `@click.right`, and `@click.self`.

## Slots

- Vue provides various ways to use slots, including template slots and default slots.
- Slots allow you to insert content into a component from the parent component.

## Using Teleport

- Teleport is a feature in Vue that allows you to render content at a different place in the DOM hierarchy.
- It's useful for rendering modals, dialogs, and other dynamic elements in your application.
