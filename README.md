  <summary><strong>Vue CLI Bigger Projects 🚀</strong></summary>

  ## Introduction
  In this section, you'll level up your Vue.js skills by tackling larger projects using Vue CLI. You'll explore setting up substantial projects, working with Vue files and templates, using template refs, creating and managing multiple components, understanding the parent-child component relationship, and building a complex component tree.

## Topics Covered

### Installing Node.js

Before diving into Vue.js projects, it's essential to install Node.js, the runtime environment for JavaScript. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server side and provides essential tools for web development.

### Using Vue CLI

Vue CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies setting up and managing Vue.js projects. It provides a structured project template and a wide range of features, making the development process smoother and more efficient.

### Creating a new project walkthrough

Starting a new Vue.js project with Vue CLI is a breeze. This walkthrough will guide you through creating a new project, ensuring a solid foundation for your development journey.

### Working with Vue files and templates

Vue.js projects are centered around components. Understanding how to work with Vue files and templates is crucial. Explore the structuring of Vue components and the creation of dynamic templates for your applications.

### Template refs

Unlock the power of template refs, a feature that allows you to reference and interact with elements in your Vue templates. Learn how to use template refs to access and manipulate elements within your components.

### Creating and managing multiple components

Large projects often require breaking the user interface into smaller, reusable components. Learn how to create and manage multiple components, enabling a more organized and maintainable codebase.

### Understanding the parent and child component relationship

Vue.js follows a hierarchical component structure, where components can be parent or child components. Understanding how parent and child components interact is essential for building complex user interfaces.

### Building a component tree

In Vue.js, components form a tree-like structure. Learn how to build a component tree by composing components and creating a clear hierarchy for your application.

## Styling and Components

- Apply style to a component, affecting not only the component itself but also other components used within it.
- Use the "scoped" attribute to limit styles to a specific component.
- For global CSS styles, create a `global.css` file in the assets folder and import it in your `main.js` file.

## Working with Props

- Props make components more reusable and dynamic.
- Use data binding (`:`) to pass data types other than strings.

## Emitting Custom Events

- Components can emit custom events, allowing you to listen to those events where the component is used.

## Click Event Modifiers

- Enhance the behavior of click events using modifiers like `@click`, `@click.right`, and `@click.self`.

## Slots

- Vue provides various ways to use slots, including template slots and default slots.
- Slots allow you to insert content into a component from the parent component.

## Using Teleport

- Teleport is a feature in Vue that allows you to render content at a different place in the DOM hierarchy.
- It's useful for rendering modals, dialogs, and other dynamic elements in your application.

   <summary><strong> Vue.js 3 Reaction Timer Game</strong></summary>
Welcome to my Vue.js 3 Reaction Timer Game project! In this section, you'll find a brief overview of my journey and the structure of this simple yet fun web application.

## Introduction

This project is a part of my Vue.js learning journey, where I decided to build a small yet engaging game to apply my Vue.js skills. Here's a quick rundown of my journey:

- Created a new Vue.js project using Vue CLI.
- Cleaned the default components and dependencies.
- Developed the game with three primary components:
  - `App.vue`: The main Vue app component responsible for game logic.
  - `Block.vue`: A component representing the flashing block for players to click as quickly as possible.
  - `Result.vue`: A component to display the user's reaction time and rank.
- Utilized Vue.js concepts, including custom events, data binding, and lifecycle hooks.
- Gained insights into Vue.js lifecycle hooks like `mounted`, `updated`, and `unmounted`.
- Used custom events to pass data between components.

So, what's this project all about, and how does it work? Let me break it down for you:

🎮 **The Game**: Imagine a flashy, colorful block that appears on your screen. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to click that block as quickly as humanly possible.

⏱️ **Reaction Time**: Every time you click the block, we measure your reaction time. Are you the Flash, or more of a "relaxed and laid-back" kind of superhero?

🥋 **Rank**: Based on your reaction time, you'll receive a rank. Will you be the ultimate "Ninja Fingers" with superhuman reflexes, or perhaps you're more of a "Casual Stroller" through the Vue-tiful world of web development?

Intrigued? Clone this repository and dive into the world of Vue.js, where learning meets fun, and you become a coding ninja in style. Time to unleash your inner superhero and become a Vue-tastic master! 🚀🦸‍♂️

   <summary><strong> Vue.js 3 Web Form Handling
</strong></summary>

Welcome to my Vue.js 3 Web Form Handling project! In this section, I'll share my exciting learning journey and the practical knowledge I gained today.

## Learning Highlights

Today's adventure revolved around diving into the world of web form handling in Vue.js. Here's a glimpse of what I discovered and achieved:

- **Setting Up Vue.js Project**: I kicked off by creating a new Vue.js project tailored for web form handling using Vue CLI. The journey started on a promising note.

- **Structured Project and Signup Form**: With the project in place, I meticulously structured it and introduced a vital component named `SignupForm.vue`. This component serves as the central hub for user sign-up activities.

- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Vue.js's `v-model` became my trusty ally for enabling two-way data binding. It seamlessly synchronized the form input fields with relevant data variables.

- **Form Input Variety**: I explored and implemented various input types, covering text, password, select boxes, and checkboxes. This created a dynamic and user-friendly environment for form interaction.

- **Keyboard Events**: Keyboard events, especially the `@keypress` event, were harnessed to capture user input for adding skills. It made the form more interactive and engaging.

- **Dynamic Skills Management**: The Vue.js magic allowed me to add and remove skills on the fly. It's all about providing a smooth user experience.

- **Form Validation**: Form validation is a crucial aspect of web forms. Today, I learned how to set up basic password validation, requiring a minimum of 6 characters.

- **Form Submission and Feedback**: Last but not least, I mastered the art of form submission. I ensured that users receive prompt feedback upon form submission. This creates a sense of accomplishment.

## What's Next?

This project isn't just about code; it's about learning, growing, and mastering Vue.js. The knowledge I gained today serves as a stepping stone to more complex and exciting projects. So, stay tuned for the next adventure!

## Branch and Commit Details

- **Branch Name**: vue-forms-tutorial
- **Commit Message**: Added form input handling and validation in the SignupForm component. Updated README for today's progress.

It's been an incredible day of learning, and I can't wait to see where the Vue.js journey takes me next. Until then, happy coding!
